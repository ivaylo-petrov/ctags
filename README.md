ctags
=====
This is my ~/.ctags file.
I use it with Editors using Exuberant Ctags
like jEdit, Sublime Text and Vim.
It can be used in many projects by putting it in 
your $HOME folder or per project, by putting it in 
your project root folder.
For now it only contains some regular expressions 
to support more Perl symbols.
